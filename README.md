This project is constructed with LastFM API and Material UI. It simply gives you recommendation and information about songs that you like to listen.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run deploy`

Deploys the app on defined homepage which you want to serve. You can check package.json for my homepage option. I've used gh-pages add-on to use that command.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
